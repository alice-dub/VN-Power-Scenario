"""Read the prepared data files.

There are 3 data sources (PDP7A, EVN 2016 report, IEA statistics)
so we need to clarify column names.

1/ Some include Imports in electricity "Production"
Here we don't --it's clearly wrong-- and use these column names:
      Supply = Production + Imports

2/ Another ambiguity is whether SmallHydro is included in "Hydro" or "Renewable"
Here we do the former and use these column names:
      Hydro = BigHydro + SmallHydro
      BigHydro = LargeHydro + InterHydro
      Renewable = Wind + Solar + Biomass
      Renewable4 = Renewable + Small hydro

3/ We do NOT include PumpedStorage in Hydro capacities

4/ We define Import as net of Exports

5/ In VN capacity stats, generation from fuel oil and from diesel is not clearly accounted for

6/ Column "capacities" means nameplate capacity.
Adding up capacities across columns is generally misleading,
since the capacity factors are not comparable, neither are the investment costs

7/ Column "capacities" is in terms of net electric power.
"Coal CCS" has a lower efficiency (higher heat rate) than "Coal" of same capacity

In 2015, coal accounted for the largest share of electricity production (34.4%),

renewable energy - including small-scale hydropower - represented only a minor part
