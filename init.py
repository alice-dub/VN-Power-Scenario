"""Common functions, units.

To clarify column names.

 1/ Some include Imports in electricity "Production". We don't.
    Imports are part of "Domestic Supply". We use these column names:
      Supply = Production + Import

 2/ We define Import as net of Exports

 3/ Another ambiguity is whether SmallHydro is included in "Hydro" or "Renewable"
    Here we do the former and use these column names:
      Hydro = BigHydro + SmallHydro
      BigHydro = LargeHydro + InterHydro
      Renewable = Wind + Solar + Biomass
      Renewable4 = Renewable + Small hydro

 4/ We do NOT include PumpedStorage in Hydro capacities or (double accounting) production

 5/ In VN capacity stats, generation from fuel oil and from diesel is not clearly accounted for.

 6/ Adding up fossil fuel generation capacities with renewable capacities is meaningless
    because the capacity factors are not comparable, neither are the investment costs
