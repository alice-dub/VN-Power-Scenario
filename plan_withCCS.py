"""Define a power plan with CCS.

Coal-fired power plants do dominate the generation sector of Vietnam from 2020 onward.
The total capacity of coal-fired power plants would increase to 55 GW by 2030.
CCS finally takes off in the international context, as China, Australia, South Africa
and a few other countries consider it a Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action.
This reduces the technical barriers, and drives down the costs of CCS technology to a point where
an affluent Vietnam can afford it by 2040.
Vietnam and other countries in the region benefits CCS capacity building programs
from IEA, ASEAN, APEC and industry associations.

In this scenario, storage activities are still initially driven by the oil industry,
who seeks to extend the end life of offshore oilfield by CO2 flooding.
But the government plays a central role early on. Incentive systems (e.g. taxes, subsidy ...)
are implemented, as soon as 2020 for R&D, to setup a pilot project, with the goal to have
a commercial scale demonstrator by 2035. In parallel, the government announces that
coal fired power plants build after 2020 will have to be capture-ready.
The electricity generation sector is an active player for CO2 transport activities.
